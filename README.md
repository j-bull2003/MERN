# Project Name

## Overview

As part of the Therapy Box Web dev recruitment challenge I've created a personal dashboard with several modules, including sign up/sign in, database design, visual design implementation, weather, news, sport, photo gallery, task list, and a favourite warmer feature.

The project requires implementing APIs for the weather, news, and sport modules, as well as incorporating geolocation to provide weather information. The news and sport modules require internal page navigation and user input to display relevant information. The photo gallery module allows users to upload and display images, while the task list module allows users to create and manage a list of tasks. Finally, the favourite warmer feature utilizes an API to display clothing suggestions based on the user's preferences.

The project requires a mandatory sign up/login module, database design, and visual design implementation.
