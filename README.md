# Project Name

## Overview

As part of the Therapy Box Web dev recruitment challenge I've created a personal dashboard with several modules, including sign up/sign in, database design, visual design implementation, weather, news, sport, photo gallery, task list, and a favourite warmer feature.

The project requires implementing APIs for the weather, news, and sport modules, as well as incorporating geolocation to provide weather information. The news and sport modules require internal page navigation and user input to display relevant information. The photo gallery module allows users to upload and display images, while the task list module allows users to create and manage a list of tasks. Finally, the favourite warmer feature utilizes an API to display clothing suggestions based on the user's preferences.

The project requires a mandatory sign up/login module, database design, and visual design implementation.

## Getting Started



1. [insert step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the frontend]

## Deployment

The backend is currently deployed live at https://right-sofa-production.up.railway.app. To deploy the backend yourself, follow these steps:

1. Download the project zip file and save it somewhere locally on your computer.
2. Open the project file in an IDE, such as Visual Studio Code.
3. Go to railway.app and set up a Railway account.
4. In your VSC terminal, type the following commands:

  brew install railway
  railway login
  
5. Go to the Railway website where you created an account and create a new project.
6. Select "Empty Project"
7. Then select "Set up your project locally"
8. After this, the website will provide you with the final three commands to enter into your VSC terminal. They are similar to what follows:
  - Install Railway CLI - (by brew, npm, curl or scoop) copy and paste the URL they provide into your terminal
  - Connect to this project - railway link ...
  - This final command railway up will deploy the backend application and provide you with a link where the "deployment is live at".
